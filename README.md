Being supporters of open systems, we decided to lay out a number of key economic indicators that we use in our work. The data that we publish on this page is distributed under the [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/) license, which means that you can use it for analysis, modification, and modification, but you must do this with an indication of the original source (this page) and only if you distribute copies with the ODbL license.

If you have questions about a specific data set, the methodology for collecting and processing information, or about the rights of use, please contact us at the email address: hello@panopticinsights.com. We will be happy to answer all your questions.
